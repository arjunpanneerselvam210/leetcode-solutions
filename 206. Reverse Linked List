// first you have to check if the head is null if it is null it has no element in the linked list 
// if not then the linked list contains more than one node in the list
// you have to maintain three pointers to keep the track of the to reverse it
// at first the curr will point the head
// then the prev and nextnode will point nullptr
// then you have to point the nextnode to the curr of next then curr->next equals prev then prev equals curr
// then curr equals nextnode
// you have to repeat this process until the curr reaches the last node in the list then the curr will point nullptr
// the you have to return the prev because it will point he last node that is reversed then the prev will be the head
